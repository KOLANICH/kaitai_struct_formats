  Device Control Blocks (DCBs) are static tables used to describe the board topology and connections external to the GPU chip.
  Each board built has specific additions to the capabilities through external devices, as well as limitations where output lines are not linked to device connectors. DCBs define the devices connected, specific information needed to configure those devices, and the external electrical connections such as HDMI and Display Port.
  DCBs do not try to explain the capabilities of the chip itself. That information is implicit in the VBIOS, firmware and drivers, which are built differently for each chip. Both the firmware and the drivers know the inherent capability of each chip, and use runtime choices to determine chip dependent code paths.
  DCB version and use
    DCB 1.x is used with Core3 VBIOS (NV5, NV10, NV11, NV15, NV20).
    DCB 2.x (2.0-2.4) is used with Core4 and Core4r2 VBIOS (NV17, NV25, NV28, NV3x).
    DCB 3.0 is used with Core5 VBIOS (NV4x, G7x).
    DCB 4.x is used with Core6, Core7, and Core8 VBIOS (G80+).
  The 4.x DCB Data Structure consists of the following parts:
    Header - The version number (e.g., 0x40 for Version 4.0), the header size, the size of each DCB Entry (currently 8 bytes), the number of valid DCB Entries, pointers to different tables, and the DCB signature. If any of the pointers here are NULL, then those tables are considered to be absent or invalid.
    Device entries list - One for each display connector (two for DVI-I connectors). Each device entry is subdivided into two main parts: Display Path Information and Device Specific Information.

          GPUs earlier than G80 have a "mirror mode" feature that enables up to two display devices to be enabled by the VBIOS, and controlled through the same VGA registers. G80 and later display hardware only supports one display in VGA mode, and the VBIOS will only enable one display device.

                  Sub-link/DisplayPort Link/Pad Link Assignment
                  This field specifies a board-supported sub-link mask for TMDS, LVDS, and SDI. For Display Port, this field specifies the link mask supported on the board.
                  For DCB 4.x: For TMDS, LVDS, and SDI, this field lists which sub-links in each SOR are routed to the connector on the board.
                  Possible sub-link values are:
                    Bit 0: Sub-link A
                    Bit 1: Sub-link B
                  If both sub-links are routed to the connector, specifying a dual-link connector, then bits 0 and 1 will both be set.
                  Note: Dual-link hook-up does not necessarily mean that both links should be used during programming. According to the DVI 1.0 specification, the crossover frequency of 165 MHZ should be the deciding factor for when dual-link vs. single-link connections should be used for TMDS use. This field merely indicates whether the connector has two links connected to it. It does not specify the actual use of either single-link or dual-link connections.
                  LVDS uses single-link or dual-link connections based on the individual panel model’s requirements. For example, SXGA panels may be run with single-link or dual-link LVDS connections.
                  For DisplayPort, this field describes which links in each SOR are routed to the connector on the board. Possible link values are:
                    Bit 0: DP-A (Display Port Resource A)
                    Bit 1: DP-B (Display Port Resource B)
                  Note: Unlike TMDS, LVDS, and SDI, if both links are routed to the connector, this does not indicate the presence of a dual-link connector. It simply means that both Display Port (DP) resources A and B may be used with this SOR. That is: DP-A or DP-B may be associated with an output device (OD) to output via DisplayPort, but not both simultaneously.
                  For DCB 4.1: For TMDS/LVDS/DP this field describes which links of the Pad Macro are routed to the connector on the board.

                  If only one bit of either of the Red, Green or Blue defines in the above DACs field is set, then this field must be set to 1 connector.
                  If two bits of either of the Red, Green or Blue defines in the above DACs field is set, then this field must be set to 1 or 2 connectors for a S-Video and/or Composite connector. But those connectors cannot be displayed simultaneously.

      This structure is REQUIRED in the DCB 4.x spec. It must be listed inside every DCB. The VBIOS and the (U)EFI driver will use the data from this structure.
      The Communications Control Block provides logical to physical translation of all the different ways that the GPU can use to communicate with other devices on the board or to displays. Prior to DCB 4.0 there were 3 different I2C Ports for GPUs and an extra 2 for Crush (nForce chipset) 11/17. The Northbridge, which holds the integrated GPU, only has 1.5 V signaling, but the DDC/EDID spec requires 3.3 V signaling. So, for Crush, we use two ports on the south bridge to handle the DDC voltage requirements.
      Note: Crush, also known as nForce or nForce2, is a motherboard chipset created by NVIDIA. Crush was released in mid-2001.
      For DCB 4.x, the norm will be 4 I2C ports as exposed on G80. With Display Port added in G98, we’ll expose a DPAUX port as well.

          The I2C spec defines 3 different communication speeds: * Standard - 100 kHz * Fast - 400 kHz * High Speed - 3.4 MHz
          Each device on an I2C bus must comply with that speed otherwise, the lowest device on that bus will clock stall the speed to what it can handle. High Speed requires extra programming to allow a specific master to send the high speed data. There are programming requirements to also allow for the fallback between higher level speeds and lower levels speeds.
          No traffic on the I2C port may exceed the speed specified here.
          Most (perhaps all) DCBs set this field to 0.

      This structure is optional. It only needs to be defined if the board is intending to provide Personal Cinema support. The VBIOS or FCODE does not need to use this structure. Only the drivers will use it.
      There are many specific defines needed for the personal cinema in order to know which devices are available. Because there are no entries needed for this table, the normal Entry Count and Entry Size will not be a part of this table for now.

    doc: |
      The GPIO Assignment table creates a logical mapping of function-based usage names to physical GPIOs within the GPU. Each pin has
        a logical ON State and
        a logical OFF State.
      Each state can be distinctly defined physically via:
        Sending output high to the GPIO,
        Sending output low to the GPIO, or
        Tristating the GPIO (Setting it to Input Mode).
      Alternately, specific GPIOs can also be assigned to carry Pulse Width Modulated (PWM) signals. This can be used for fan speed control or backlight power control.
      This table is required in all ROMs. It must be listed inside every DCB. The VBIOS and the FCODE will use the data from this structure.

          When moving to GF110, the HW team merged the Normal/Alternate/Sequencer modes of the GPIO into one 8 bit field in a GPIO register. In order to better manage that change, we decided to increase the revision from the initial 0x40 version to 0x41 and re-organize the bit fields in each GPIO table entry to accommodate a new field that matches the field in the HW register directly.
          Version 0x41, as used for GF11x+ / Core75 and future cores, is listed below.

              Note: Some GPIOs have some overloading with HW Slowdown features and the detected presence of a thermal chip. HW Slowdown consists of two parts:
                a. Enabling/Disabling the functionality through GPIO 8. (Note, this functionality is only available on NV18 and NV30+ chips.)
                b. Triggering GPIO 8 when the functionality is enabled. The trigger can come from a thermal device, external power connector, some logic on the board, a combination of the above, etc. The trigger method is what the GPIO function should define, but by defining it, we understand that we must enable HW slowdown (A) as well.
              Trigger or Assert implies that the GPIO 8 is brought LOW and since the functionality is enabled (A), the HW Clocks are reduced by 2x, 4x or 8x. The opposite of trigger/assert is deassert.
              In most cases today, HW Slowdown is set to ACTIVE LOW due to the ACTIVE LOW signal from the thermal chips. We can program GPIO 8 based HW Slowdown to be ACTIVE HIGH, but then the trigger level for the line routed to GPIO 8 must follow the ACTIVE HIGH signaling.

          Some boards require extra control, since we don’t have enough internal GPIO pins to manage them. The board designers add an external chip that is used to control more GPIO pins on the board. Because we expect that there could be more than just one external GPIO controller on the board, we have separated the tables into Master and Specific. The Master table lists pointers to all the different external GPIO controllers on the board. The Specific Table lists the data associated with one controller on the board. A pointer to the External GPIO Assignment Master Table is found in the GPIO Assignment Table Header.

  connector_table:
    doc: |
      This table is required in the ROM. This table should always be defined to allow graphical representations of the board to be created. This table will be used only by the the driver.
      For purposes of this table a connector is defined as the end point on the display path where one display can be attached. This may be the card edge or attachment points on a breakout cable.
      A connector can only output one stream at a time. So, if you have a Low-Force Helix (LFH) port on the back of the card, the connector is defined as a DVI-I adapter of that breakout cable. That is, there are 2 connectors for every 1 LFH port on the back of a card.
      Notes: There are some connector types, 0x50 through 0x57, that require extra code in the detection routines inside any code that uses the DCB. For Mobile systems, some connectors might only be on the actual body of the notebook. Also, some connectors might only show up on the docking station. Therefore we need to make sure that we don’t allow anyone to select a device that is not actually present. So, when we see connectors with the "if not docked" and "if docked" text in the description, we must make sure that our detection code checks the docked condition first and possibly culls any further detection attempts if the docked condition is not met.
